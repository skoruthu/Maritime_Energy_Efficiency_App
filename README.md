# Visualizing_Maritime_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics
<h2> Deployment on Heroku can be found <a href="https://bt5110-maritime.herokuapp.com/"> <strong> here </strong> </a>. </h2>

#### App Deployed 
Django application on Heroku

#### Techniques Employed
Advanced SQL queries (e.g: Roll-Up, Partition, Rank, Percentile), Star Schema, Dimension Table, Dynamic Website Design

### Context
International Maritime Organisation oversees the regulation of the energy efficiency of different ships in order to avoid overpollution. By collecting ship, verifier and date data, interesting insights and visualization can be done. <br>

Among others, the following use cases were explored: <br>
(i) Fuel consumption of each ship type and engine vs its performance or features <br>
(ii) Most polluting Maritime Verifiers <br>
(iii) Reported efficiency of ships built in different years <br>

We examined the best way to present the data inside a Star Schema & Dimension Table (see report).
